**US. POLLUTION ANALYSIS**


**Dashboard Link:**-https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/e19a493d-8fed-4637-9e54-baec86d0a9bc/ReportSection?experience=power-bi






**Problem Statement:-**

Air pollution is a growing concern globally, impacting the environment and public health. This project focuses on leveraging Power BI to analyze and visualize pollution data in the United States.Air pollution is the contamination of air due to the presence of substances in the atmosphere that are harmful to the health of humans and other living beings, or cause damage to the climate or to materials.






**Stepwise Process:-**

Step 1: Import the Data

    *Open Power BI Desktop.
    *In the Home tab, click on "Get Data" and choose the appropriate data source (Excel, CSV, SQL Server, etc.).

Step 2: Understand Your Data Structure

    *Explore the data structure in the "Query Editor" by clicking on "Transform Data."
    *Review columns, data types, and check for any inconsistencies or missing values.

Step 3: Clean and Transform Data
Handle Missing Values:


    *Identify and handle missing values.  replace them with zeros or use techniques like interpolation or mean imputation.

Data Type Conversion:

    *Ensure that data types are appropriate for analysis. For example, dates should be in the date format, numeric columns should be numeric, etc.

Remove Duplicates:

    *Eliminate duplicate rows to avoid skewing analysis results.

Filter Rows:

    *Filter out unnecessary rows based on specific criteria.

Rename Columns:

    *Rename columns to make them more meaningful and understandable.

    *Preview your data in Power BI to ensure that it looks as expected.

Data Quality Checks:

    *Perform data quality checks to validate that the data is accurate and meets the requirements.

 Load Data into Power BI
Close and Apply:

    *Once satisfied with the transformations, close the Query Editor and apply changes.
